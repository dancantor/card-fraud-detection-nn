# card-fraud-detection-nn

## Project Description
This project will focus on predicting credit card frauds using Neural Networks. For now, the intended model to be used is Multilayer Perceptron (Feed Forward Neural Network). During the experiments, this might change.

The problem of credit card frauds is well known and aims, based on historical transactions with various information to establish if a certain current transaction can be considered a problematic or not. That being said, this can be considered a classification algorithm with two possible labels: fraud and not fraud.

The project will include preprocessing of the data, feature engineering and the implementation of the ANN architecture.

A Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) is a type of artificial neural network with an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Neurons in each layer are connected, and weights and biases are assigned to these connections. The network uses activation functions, like ReLU, to introduce non-linearity. During training, the backpropagation algorithm adjusts weights to minimize the error between predicted and actual outputs. MLPs are versatile, commonly used for tasks like classification and regression on structured data.
